# üéß Headset Battery Indicator

A simple, lightweight Python script that displays the battery level of your wireless headset in your Linux system tray.

It uses **PySide6 (Qt)** for the tray icon, making it compatible with most modern desktop environments such as **KDE Plasma**, **GNOME**, **XFCE**, and **Cinnamon**.

## ‚≠ê Core Dependency: HeadsetControl

This script **does not work on its own** ‚Äî it is a graphical front-end that relies entirely on the **[HeadsetControl](https://github.com/Sapd/HeadsetControl)** utility.

You **must** install `headsetcontrol` for this indicator to function.  
All credit for hardware communication and device support goes to the [Sapd/HeadsetControl](https://github.com/Sapd/HeadsetControl) project.
